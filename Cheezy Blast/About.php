            <P>As we build a world with more Cheezy Blast, we’re also sharpening our set of shared values and elevating our brands and business practices through our Recipe for Good, our global citizenship and sustainability strategy. This means listening to and engaging with stakeholders around our three priority areas of Food, Planet and People. We’re on a journey when it comes to our sustainability work and are proud of the progress we’re making on the priority issues that are most material to our business. See how our efforts are being recognized.
We’re also extremely proud of the 1.5 million employees and franchise associates in our system around the globe and the unique culture we’ve built grounded on innovation, inclusion and growth. We believe in our people, trust in their positive intentions, encourage ideas from everyone and have actively developed a workforce that is diverse in style and background.
